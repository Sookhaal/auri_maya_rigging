# Auri Maya Rigging
*Auri Maya Rigging* is a rigging library for [Auri](https://github.com/Sookhaal/auri).

The goal is to have a **fully** modular rigging tool, from humans to the weirdest creature you may imagine.

The library covers the whole skeleton & controllers creation, as well as the **features** an animator expects from a production rig.

# How it works
Modules are properly categorized in order to make them easy to find.

modules connection work with a parenting system, evey modules can choose an output from any other module as a parent to be connected to.

As of now most of the modules are completely independant from each other, but some of them are not and they must have a specific parent (hand, foot and bird paw). In the future, those modules will be independant as well.

# Examples


# Who is using it?
Auri Maya Rigging is used at [ArtFX](http://www.artfx.fr/en/) for the rigging process of the 5th yearâ€™s graduation projects.
